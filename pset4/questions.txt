0.  BMP: Over 4 billion (color is supported by the first 24 bits, the other 
eight are translucency). JPEG: 16 million. PNG: 16 million. GIF: 256 colors.

1.  GIF

2.  Lossless compression will retain all "information" through the 
compressed and uncompressed states. Lossy compression will eliminate certain
information when it is compressed (redundnat ones). So when its uncompressed,
information will be lost (but the user may not notice).

3.  JPEG

4.  When the file is deleted, so is the information in the access table. But the
file remains on the hardrive. In other words, its like crossing out the name of 
a chapter in the index of a book, but the chapter still exists within the book.

5.  Using secure delete options which replaces the disk section with zeroes.

6.  This header defines a set of specified integral type aliases with certain
width requirements, along with macros specifying their limits and macro 
functions to create values of these types.

7.  Clarifies how we specifically intend to use data. uint24_t means that it's 
24 bits wide.

8.  BYTE: 1 byte
DWORD:4 bytes
LONG: 4 bytes
WORD: 2 bytes

9.  First 2 bytes is WORD which has to do with bfType. It must be set to the 
signature word BM (0x4D42) to indicate it is a bitmap.

10. bfSize = size of the bitmap file in bytes
biSize= size of the structure in bytes.

11. The bitmap is a top-down device-independent bitmap, it's origins is in the 
upper left corner.

12. The biBitCount (dtermines the number of bits that define each pixel and the
maximum number of colors in the bitmap).

13. Because it cannot create the outfile to write to.

14. The program reads 1 RGB triple at a time.

15. 3 bytes so the end product is 12 bytes. If the bi.bWidth is 3 pixels, there
are 9 bytes. So +3 bytes to make it a multiple of 4.

16. Skips padding and looks for the next pixel.

17. Integer constant which specifies that the provided offset is relative to the
current file position.
